##### Personality and Motivation are determinants of seating preferences by students in lecture halls. 
*Resources and citations for social aspects and others. Connection to intrinsic motivation (not academic), rationale for area of study, p15, interview questions*
- introverts at the back (slightly)
- habit but also unconscious behavior
- 87% always sit in same area
- earlier studies showed higher motivation in front but newer doesn't (see end of page 7 and p8 also citations)
- Hilliard Waller (1932): who claimed that students seated at the front of the classroom were zealous and overdependent, while those at the back were rebellious.
- other studies Burda and Brooks 1996; Mercincavage and Brooks 1990, (as cited in Marshall & Losonczy-Marshall, 2013) showed motivated in front
- this study showed same motivation, but intrinsic motivation back
-  Marshall & Losonczy-Marshall, (2013): achievemnt decreases row-by-row
-  Parker & Hoopes (2011):    declare based on their seat  allocation design study that in any given circumstance personality traits remain constant. Students were assigned a stay seat or a move seat. The move students changed seats every day. The conclusion of this experiment was that a small group of students will perform well under any conditions, another group of students will under-perform under any conditions and the larger portion of the class will be influenced by such variables as seating position and personality traits

##### Segregation in the classroom - An empirical test of the Schelling model
*Segregation model, not random, strategic&preferences, danger of social polarization, influence of early arrivals, individual choice results in predictable macro patterns*
- Schelling's segregation model, theory of collective choice applied to seating decisions
- considerable segregation based on individual characteristics even in low-cost decisions-making situation
- Clusters, but avoid sitting directly next to someone
- Auditorium seating (social processes) aren't random but guided by both strategic reasoning and individual preferences
- "seating behaviour in an auditorium is one of the processes in which independent individual decisions should lead to some predictable macro patterns"
- guided by a mix of informal rules and individual predispositions
- the clusters of early entrants serve as important signposts for latecomers.
- The social predisposition and the self-declared seating preferences are final sources of influence.
- The overall composition of the classroom shows that students with a certain profile tend to sit in groups.
- Our findings generally support a large body of formal and computational studies that alert us to the danger of social polarization even in the absence of divisive preferences.

*Front part achieved better with random seat allocation*

##### Classroom Seating Preference as a Function of Student Personality
*Students in action seat (front and middle) have different personality, assertive, imaginative, practical (questinnaire based)*

##### The Impact of Seating Location and Seating Type on Student Performance
*Studies showed contradictory effects of seating location on academic performance, good resources on how people view themselves and how others view them. No difference based on seating location found*

##### The impact of classroom seating location and computer use on student academic performance
*Performance degrades by distance, previous studies (cited) have contradictory results*
