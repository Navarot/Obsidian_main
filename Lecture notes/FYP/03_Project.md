### Recommended Readings from Christian:
I would recommend starting with the textbook by Jurafsky and Martin, one of the standard textbooks in NLP, particularly Chapters 2 (Preprocessing) and 3 (N-gram language modelling). You can find the chapters here: https://web.stanford.edu/~jurafsky/slp3/
For the part on data annotation and annotation quality, I'd go directly to the journal article by Artstein and Poesio: https://aclanthology.org/J08-4004.pdf
