- R$^2$  connection to r in Pearson (really just squared?)
- Exact method of standard error line plot
- More about OLS regression
- Transforming variables with skewed distributions for linear models - aim is to have normal distribution? Or uniform?

## General
- Veronica's lecture definitely shouldn't be during the last week of project 01. That class should have been a Q&A. It was really bad having that class (and the runthrough - was it actually the last class) one day before the deadline.
- SAP's lecture about groupwork (first lecture after Project 01 oral presentation) was amazing. There is something good about having it after the first project - you can reflect on the groupwork during the first project. Ofc this way you don't benefit from it during the first project. But, if you choose groups freely for project 02 and 03, then it should have been before forming the groups.
- Veronica's group forming / ambition exercise wasn't too useful :(
- GROUPS SHOULD BE RANDOMLY SHUFFLED: IT WAS EXTREMELY DAMAGING FOR MANY. People went behind each other's back, hedging their bets, it drove a wedge between people. It was the literal worst way this could be done. Like a taking a page from Milgram's book for a social experiment!!!!! 

## Project 01

- Data scavenging, incorporating external data should have been the first thing after the intro (and maybe some data cleaning knowledge). Having it as basically the last item meant that we felt we had to basically start from the beginning. It would be much much better if we could have already worked with our full dataset from the beginning.
- Maybe a mid-project review / Q&A? - Workload was uneven, even tho Michele tried to give an overview about the project at the beginning, it wasn't clear what actually needs to be done, it felt like we could only start with the actual project when all the material was presented - see point above about incorporating another source.
